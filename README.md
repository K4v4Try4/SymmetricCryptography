# Symmetric Key Cryptography (SPN)

This project implements **symmetric key cryptography** using a **Substitution-Permutation Network (SPN)**.

---

## Description

Symmetric key cryptography uses **the same secret key** for both encryption and decryption.  
- The sender encrypts plaintext with the secret key to produce **ciphertext**.  
- The receiver uses the same key to recover the **original message**.

---

## SPN Architecture

The algorithm is based on a **Substitution-Permutation Network**:  
- **Substitution (S-box):** modifies the bits of the data.  
- **Permutation (P-box):** rearranges the position of bits.  

These steps are repeated in multiple **rounds** to increase security, mixing and complicating the plaintext.

---

## Implementation

- Language: **C#** (Windows Forms, .NET Framework 8)  
- Reference: Example from "Sistemi e Reti" Volume 3 by Prof. Paolo Ollari, Chapter B3 – Information Security, Section 1 – Symmetric Key Cryptography, page 111.
- S-box: 7 bits, P-box: 12 bits  
- Fully **local execution**, no external connections required

## Note

The code is fully **commented** and includes **custom UI graphics generated by AI**.
